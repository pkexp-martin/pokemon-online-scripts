This is a rewrite of the Pokémon Online Scripts (https://github.com/po-devs/po-server-goodies).

The project uses the TypeScript language and will be compiled to plain JavaScript files, which you could use in Pokémon Online.

Since every command could be used by any user at the moment, DO NOT USE IT FOR A PUBLIC SERVER!
